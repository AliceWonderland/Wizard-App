## Notes
Used a boilerplate for quick-start. Kept the convention, dir structure, etc... because it was easier but also as an exercise in adhering to coding style.

Based on webpack+react+json-server Boilerplate by 
https://github.com/nickjazz/webpack-react-json-server

Decided on this approach as a guideline for organizing the components - https://medium.com/@l_e/writing-a-wizard-in-react-8dafbce6db07


#### Boilerplate Main tools
* eslint
* json-server
* sass
* webpack
* faker
* jQuery

* react
